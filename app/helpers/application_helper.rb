# ApplicationHelper
#
# Provides helper methods for views, including pagination and custom calculations for electricity readings.
#
# Methods:
# - calculate_difference(collection, reading): Calculates the difference between the current and previous reading in a collection. Returns '-' if the result is negative.
# - calculate_day_zero(readings): Estimates the date when the reading will reach zero based on the rate of consumption. Returns '-' if not enough data or if the rate is non-positive.
